# Binsr Inspect Challenge

# **Binsr Home Inspection Report Generation Hackathon**

### **Data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12ftwHn3i-h6Db_JPY98VuLrtP2js0e6E?usp=drive_link**

## **🎯 Challenge Overview**

**In Simple Terms: You're building a PDF report for home inspections with a server!**

### **This Hackathon Has Two Parts:**

### **Part 1: TREC Challenge (Required)**

Generate a Texas Real Estate Commission (TREC) formatted inspection report by filling out the official Texas template with the provided data. This is the main challenge everyone must complete.

### **Part 2: Bonus Round (Optional)**

Create your own custom-designed inspection report using the same data. Show us your creativity and UX/UI skills by designing something better than the standard reports!

### **What You're Given:**

1. **`inspection.json`** - A data file containing all the information from a real home inspection (property details, issues found, inspector notes, image URLs, etc.)
2. **`TREC_Template_Blank.pdf`** - An empty Texas inspection form that needs to be filled out
3. **`TREC_Sample_Filled.pdf`** - An example showing how the TREC form should look when properly filled with data
4. **`Binsr_Standard_Inspection_Output.pdf`** - An example of what current inspection reports look like in the industry

### **What You Need to Build:**

A program that reads the `inspection.json` file and automatically creates professional PDF inspection reports.

### **What You Need to Submit:**

1. **`output_pdf.pdf`** - (Inside your GitHub repo) Your generated TREC report (matching the Texas template format) - **REQUIRED**
2. **`bonus_pdf.pdf`** - (Inside your GitHub repo) Your own creative inspection report design using the same data - **OPTIONAL for bonus points**
3. Your code on GitHub with instructions on how to run it

**Think of it like this:** You're automating what an inspector currently does manually - taking inspection notes and photos and turning them into a professional report that homebuyers can read.

### **Visual Workflow:**

```
📄 inspection.json (input data)
        ↓
    Your Code
        ↓
    ┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
    ↓                     ↓
📑 output_pdf.pdf    📑 bonus_pdf.pdf
(TREC Format)        (Your Creative Design)

```

## **📋 Challenge Requirements**

### **Main Challenge: TREC Template Report Generation**

**What to do:**

1. Read the data from `inspection.json`
2. Fill out the Texas TREC template with this data
3. Generate a PDF that looks like `TREC_Sample_Filled.pdf`

**Step-by-step:**

- Parse the JSON file to extract property info, inspection findings, and images
- Map each piece of data to the correct field in the TREC template
- Check the right boxes (e.g., "Inspected", "Not Inspected", "Deficient")
- Insert images where appropriate
- Generate `output_pdf.pdf` that matches the TREC format

### **Bonus Challenge: Creative Report Design**

**What to do:**

1. Use the same `inspection.json` data
2. Create your OWN report design (don't copy TREC)
3. Make it better than `Binsr_Standard_Inspection_Output.pdf`

**Ideas for your creative report:**

- Better organization of information
- Modern, clean design
- Charts or graphs for summary data
- Color coding for severity levels
- Better image galleries
- Executive summary section
- Generate `bonus_pdf.pdf` with your custom design

If you’re doing the bonus round, make sure you include (check the Binsr Standard Inspection Report):

**Table of Contents**

- Clickable sections that navigate to respective content
- Dynamic generation based on available sections
- Clear section numbering and page references

## **📁 Provided Resources**

1. **Data File:** `inspection.json`
   - Complete inspection data for one property
   - Includes all findings, images URLs, and property details
2. **TREC Template:** `TREC_Template_Blank.pdf`
   - Official Texas inspection report template
   - Use as reference for structure and formatting
3. **Sample Output:** `TREC_Sample_Filled.pdf`
   - Example of correctly filled TREC report
   - Reference for expected output quality
4. **Standard Report Example:** `Binsr_Standard_Inspection_Output.pdf`
   - Current industry-standard report format
   - Reference for general inspection report structure

## _📂 Understanding the inspection.json Structure_

The data follows a _3-level hierarchy_:

📋 Sections (e.g., "Roof System", "Electrical Systems")
└── 📝 Line Items (e.g., "Roof Covering", "Wiring")
└── 💬 Comments (actual findings/observations)
├── 📷 Photos (array of image URLs)
└── 🎥 Videos (array of video URLs)

_Key Points:_

- ⁠ ⁠*Sections* contain _Line Items_
  •⁠ ⁠*Line Items* contain _Comments_
  •⁠ ⁠*Comments* contain _Photos_ and _Videos_
  •⁠ ⁠Each level has an ⁠ order ⁠ field for sequencing

## That's it. Figure out the rest by exploring the JSON!

## **❓ FAQ**

**Q: Can we use third-party PDF libraries?**
A: Yes, any PDF generation library is allowed.

**Q: How should we handle data that doesn't fit the TREC template?**
A: Include it in the most appropriate section or add some notes in your repo

**Q: Are there file size limits for the PDFs?**
A: No hard limit, but smaller file sizes will score higher in performance criteria. It will decrease your loading time too.

**Q: Can we add features not mentioned in the requirements?**
A: Yes! Innovation is encouraged, especially in the creative report.

**Q: Should the creative report follow any specific state requirements?**
A: No, it should be your own design but remain professional and suitable for home inspection purposes.

**Q: What if an image URL is broken or unavailable?**
A: Handle gracefully with a placeholder image or text indicating "Image unavailable" or just pick a random house picture

**Q: Can we modify the inspection.json data structure?**
A: No, your solution must work with the provided data structure as-is.

## **⚠️ Important Notes**

- Ensure your solution can dynamically generate reports (not hard-coded)
- Test PDF viewing across different PDF readers
- Verify all links and media elements work correctly
- Remember: PDFs don't support embedded videos - use clickable links instead
- Use "Data not found in test data" for any missing fields
- Both PDFs must be generated from the same `inspection.json` file
- File names must be exactly `output_pdf.pdf` and `bonus_pdf.pdf`
